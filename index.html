<h6>What is League of Legends?</h6>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p class="quote">
  League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. As of January 2014, over 67 million people play League of Legends per month, 27 million per day, and over 7.5 million concurrently during peak hours. League of Legends has spawned a large, active competitive scene. In North America and Europe, Riot Games organizes the League of Legends Championship Series, which consists of 8 professional teams in each continent.
</p> 

<h6>Gameplay</h6>
<p>
  There are two teams, with five players on each team. Each player controls a unique <strong>champion</strong> that has its own unique abilities. Each team has a base, one at the bottom left corner of the map and one at the top right corner of the map. There are three <strong>lanes</strong> that <strong>minions</strong> from each team pass through, labeled <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong>, and <strong>Bottom</strong>. In between these three lanes is the <strong>jungle</strong> where there exists <strong>neutral</strong> monsters. Throughout the lanes and the bases, there are friendly and hostile <strong>turrets</strong> and <strong>inhibitors</strong> in the bases. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy <strong>nexus</strong> in their base, which is protected by these buildings.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to normal games, Riot provdes a tier system in which players can play ranked games. The skill tiers are <strong>Bronze</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong>, <strong>Platinum</strong>, <strong>Diamond</strong>, <strong>Master</strong>, and <strong>Challenger</strong>. In the higher tiers, the norm is to have a team composition that consists of the following
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Top Laner</li>
    <li>Jungler</li>
    <li>Mid Laner</li>
    <li>Attack Damage Carry</li>
    <li>Support</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h6>Objectives</h6>

<p>
  With the gameplay in mind, we wanted to explore the following:
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explore the <strong>challenger</strong> tier dataset and find interesting results.</li>
    <li>Try to predict outcomes of games by training on data and testing on other data.</li>
    <li>Try to predict team gold differential based on team compositions.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h6>Data Collection</h6>

<p>
  To perform the analysis, we needed to get data first. What we wanted was all the data from high level matches. Unforunately, Riot's API is more suited for looking up a specific player's data, and not all the matches in a specific tier.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily, there was still a way to get the data that we wanted. We were able to retrieve a list of players in the challenger tier (there are 200 of them), and for each player in the challenger tier, we retrieved a list of match IDs. We combined all the lists into a set and removed duplicates and filtered out only the relevant matches. Since the game will have changes every year, we decided to focus only on the 2014 season. The last problem was that we were rate limited by the API to 10 requests every 10 seconds. Thus, in order to retrieve the data, we had different computers run the retrieval on different portions of the dataset, and then we stored the data into a file so that we did not have to poll Riot's API again.
</p>

<p>
  After retrieving the data, we found that some of the matches were inconsistent with our assumptions. A few of the matches contained multiple junglers on a single team, and a few of the matches contained no mid laners. We filtered out these matches because in actual professional play, these unorthodox compositions never happen.
