<h6>What is League of Legends?</h6>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p class="quote">
  League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. As of January 2014, over 67 million people play League of Legends per month, 27 million per day, and over 7.5 million concurrently during peak hours. League of Legends has spawned a large, active competitive scene. In North America and Europe, Riot Games organizes the League of Legends Championship Series, which consists of 8 professional teams in each continent.
</p> 

<h6>Gameplay</h6>
<p>
  There are two teams, with five players on each team. Each player controls a unique <strong>champion</strong> that has its own unique abilities. Each team has a base, one at the bottom left corner of the map and one at the top right corner of the map. There are three <strong>lanes</strong> that <strong>minions</strong> from each team pass through, labeled <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong>, and <strong>Bottom</strong>. In between these three lanes is the <strong>jungle</strong> where there exists <strong>neutral</strong> monsters. Throughout the lanes and the bases, there are friendly and hostile <strong>turrets</strong> and <strong>inhibitors</strong> in the bases. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy <strong>nexus</strong> in their base, which is protected by these buildings.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to normal games, Riot provdes a tier system in which players can play ranked games. The skill tiers are <strong>Bronze</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong>, <strong>Gold</strong>, <strong>Platinum</strong>, <strong>Diamond</strong>, <strong>Master</strong>, and <strong>Challenger</strong>. In the higher tiers, the norm is to have a team composition that consists of the following
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Top Laner</li>
    <li>Jungler</li>
    <li>Mid Laner</li>
    <li>Attack Damage Carry</li>
    <li>Support</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h6>Motivation</h6>
<p>
  Given the structured set up of League Games, a pattern emerges especially in the higher levels of play and during <b>ranked</b> games where players try their best and care about game outcomes. This results in a "game meta", where teams have one of each kind of role listed above selected from a much smaller pool of high-level competitive champions. Professional game commentators usually emphasize champion matchups and synergies when talking about the results of each game, and a single unconventional champion pick can cause an uproar of excitement in the stadium because they are so rare. 
</p>
<p>
  Because league professional competitions have been increasingly heavily covered in the press, and involve millions of dollars of sponsorships, revenue, and prize money, we wanted to figure out how much a simple champion selection can actually affect the outcome of a game. How much of a professional League of Legends game win is the result of superior skill, and how much of it is decided by each team's luck and knowledge of which champions to pick at the beginning? This is what we set out to find out.
